# 04 Web APIs: Code Quiz

##
You know that Big Quiz they have at the end of every year in the U.K.?
Usually Noel Fielding and Ricard Ayoade are on it and its hilarious?
Well this isn't that.
But it's close!

A timed, score keeping quiz grilling you on all things coding!

Using Javascript we have built a dynamic, interactive, multiple choice quizzical game.

It runs in the browser with scores saved on local storage (I know, I'm also impressed) and styled to the nines with CSS. 

Behold! Quizzasaurus!
